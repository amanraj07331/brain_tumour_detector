# üß† Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to **brain tumor detection** using medical images (likely MRI scans). By leveraging the power of **TensorFlow** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model can classify brain tumors with high accuracy.

> ‚öïÔ∏è Early detection of brain tumors can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to aid radiologists and medical professionals with AI-assisted diagnosis.

## üîç How to Run

1. Clone this repo or open the notebook in Colab:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanraj07331/brain-tumour-detection
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy opencv-python
   ```

3. Mount Google Drive (if using Colab):
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

4. Load the trained model and run inference on test images.

## üß† Model Architecture (Suggested)

- Input: MRI scan image (resized)
- CNN Layers: Convolution ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPooling
- Dense Layers: Fully Connected ‚Üí Dropout
- Output: Softmax layer for multi-class classification (e.g., Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary)

## üåü Suggested Improvements (Next-Level Ideas)

| Area | Suggestion |
|------|------------|
| üîÑ Data | Augment data (rotation, zoom, flip) to improve generalization |
| üìä Dashboard | Create an interactive web UI using Streamlit or Gradio |
| üè• Explainability | Add Grad-CAM visualizations to highlight tumor regions |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment | Deploy model on Hugging Face or Flask API |
| üìà Evaluation | Use precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix |
| üß† Model | Try transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs (ResNet50, EfficientNet) |
| üîó Integration | Connect with hospital database or PACS system for real use |
