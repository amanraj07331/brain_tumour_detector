# üß† Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to **brain tumor detection** using medical images (likely MRI scans). By leveraging the power of **TensorFlow** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model can classify brain tumors with high accuracy.

> ‚öïÔ∏è Early detection of brain tumors can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to aid radiologists and medical professionals with AI-assisted diagnosis.
